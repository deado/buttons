Test and learning xbox 360 homebrew application written by deado.
Based off the buttons application made by ced9511. I was unable to get his working for me,
so in an attempt to learn how to make homebrew myself and testing and debugging;
I rewrote it from scratch as my own. I will be using this as a basis to keep building and
learning C and libxenon.
